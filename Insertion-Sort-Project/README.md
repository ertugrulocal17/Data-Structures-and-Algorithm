# First Project - Insertion-Sort

[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

## 1) Write the stages of the array according to the sort type

```
[22,27,16,2,18,6]
[2,27,16,22,18,6]
[2,6,16,22,18,27]
[2,6,16,18,22,27]
```

## 2) Write the Big-O notation

`O(n^2)`

## 3) Time Complexity

Average Case = O(n^2)
Worst Case = O(n^2)
Best Case = O(n)

## 4) What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted?

`Average Case`

## [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] => Write the first 4 steps of the array according to Insertion-Sort

```
[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
[2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]
[2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
[2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]
```
